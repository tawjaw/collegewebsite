# Lab 2 React Todo Application
**Due Date: Monday October 11 by Midnight**

### Instructions

You will be building a ToDo application similar to what we've been doing in class. You can download the react project on the link below. 

The project has most of the structure behind your app already built, but missing all the functionalities. Each part however, is commented with instructions of what needs to be done. 

### Bonus Grade

There's up to 10% bonus on styling. If you have mistakes or do not have the full functionalities implemented (grade lower than 100%) then your styling can get you up to 10% bonus on your grade. 

### Submission

You will be submitting your project online on LEA and demonstrating your solution in the upcoming lab after the due date in class.
Before you zip your project to upload to LEA, make sure you **delete node_modules folder from your project!!** If your project is more than 1MB it means there is something wrong and I will not be accepting your submission. After deleting node_modules, zip the full project and upload the zipped file to LEA before the due date.
