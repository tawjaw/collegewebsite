# Lab 4 React Todo Application with REST API

**Due Date: Friday, November 4 by Midnight**

### Instructions

You will be building a ToDo application similar to the app you built in lab2 but using a backend API provided to you. You can download the react project on the link below.

The project has most of the structure behind your app already built, but missing all the functionalities. Each part is commented with instructions of what needs to be done.

The TODO comments in the project tells you what type of request you need to make and what the URL + data is.

You should refer to the axios documentation to help you figure out how to make the proper request. For example, [this part](https://axios-http.com/docs/post_example) of the documentation shows you how to make a POST request.

You should also make use of Postman which you can download [here](https://www.postman.com), which you can make different type of requests and explore the API.

### Bonus Grade

There's up to 10% bonus on styling. If you have mistakes or do not have the full functionalities implemented (grade lower than 100%) then your styling can get you up to 10% bonus on your grade.

### Submission

You will be submitting your project online on LEA and demonstrating your solution in the upcoming lab after the due date in class.
Before you zip your project to upload to LEA, make sure you **delete node_modules folder from your project!!** If your project is more than 1MB it means there is something wrong and I will not be accepting your submission. After deleting node_modules, zip the full project and upload the zipped file to LEA before the due date.
